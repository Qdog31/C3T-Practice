We can see the above code within the shell3 file so we know that this is the start of a function. Then, we need to move that location to a different library so we do the below code: 

[BITS 64]
mov rax,0x401236
call (rax)

we used: nasm shell4.asm to compile the file into machine code 
 
We move the print_flag function into rax so we can call it directly.
