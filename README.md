# C3T-Practice Repo

This repo contains some of the scripts, write-ups, and challenge files that I have worked on during my time on the Cadet Competitive Cyber Team (C3T). 

I plan on updating this whenever we have structured time to learn about a specific category. If you are curious to see what I am learning about, feel free to watch this repo and give it a star :)
